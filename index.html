                    Luna is a German shepherd mix and a fireball of energy.
                    Oftentimes, destroying anything in her path she will take and
                    hide all your socks, shoes, and clothes for her to chew on.
                    She loves playing catch at the park, it always gives her the zoomies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Luna is a very jealous, loving, and protective dog.
                    She really embraces her inner chihuahua and will bark at any stranger, car, or noise at night.
                    She makes the perfect guard dog. But she is not at all aggressive. Luna is all bark no bite!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Pappy is a 7 year old morkie. Most days he prefers to spend it
                    laying around the house in his various favorite spots.
                    Most of the time you can find him lying in his bed. He loves going with walks,
                    but still hasn’t figured out how to approach other dogs without scaring them off.
                    He loves his family and loves to keep intruders away even for his size.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He also enjoys playing with his favorite basketball. He loves pushing it around,
                    scratching it, or even talking with it. He also loves his little stuffed animal too.
                    Pappy also loves to be scratched and will ask you to keep scratching until he is happy.

                <img src = "" alt="Akita named Hachi sitting on the front lawn" width="400px">
                <p>
                    Hachi is a 13 year old Akita. He’s a very old boy who likes to play in snow
                    and run laps around our yard. He is super nice and never bites. He is timid but friendly and
                    will always come and greet visitors with a smile and a few barks.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Hachi is a jealous dog. Although shy, he does not like it when other dogs steal
                    attention from him and he will lightly bite them. When Hachi shared the house with another
                    dog, a small poodle, he would constantly bicker with the poodle when it was being loud.

                <img src = "" alt="White schnoodle laying in grass" width="400px">
                <p>
                    Milo is a 6 year old schnoodle. He is super energetic and his favorite game is fetch,
                    which he wants to play all the time — yes, even when it’s pitch black outside or the
                    weather is unideal. Milo is also loving and kind, at least to humans. When he’s around
                    other dogs, he is either jealous of the attention they’re receiving, or ignores them
                    because he has other priorities (chasing a ball).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Milo is also a pretty smart dog, although he doesn't always use it for good. He can roll
                    over on command, and use his sense of scent to find a hidden treat. But he’s also figured
                    out some loopholes to get what he wants. For example, he has been trained to nudge the bell
                    near the front door to indicate that he needs to be walked. Recently, though, he’s learned that
                    he can just pretend like he wants to go on a walk, but instead lead us around the house to the
                    backyard so he can play. In case it wasn’t clear: Milo loves to play. Although he can be sneaky,\
                    my family loves him more than anything.

                <img src = "" alt="White and gray Bernedoodle sitting on a couch and smiling." width="400px">
                <p>
                    Cooky is an 11 month old Bernedoodle. He likes to play, run around, go on walks, eat snacks and treats
                    (not his own dog food), get pets and belly rubs, and cuddle. You can usually find him playing with his
                    toys in the living room, chilling in the office room with my dad, or cooling off in the garage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He’s still a baby, but he can get super hyper. Whenever someone rings the doorbell, Cooky gets really
                    excited, barking and dashing towards the front door. He also jumps really high when he’s hyper and wags
                    his tail like crazy. Overall, though, he likes to chill and cuddle just as much as he likes to play.

                <p>
                    Nickels was adopted from Ohio in 2010. He turned 13 years old in June 2023,
                    which he celebrated with a Taylor Swift themed birthday party. Nickels often travels
                    with his family; he has been to over ten states. He has lived in Illinois and California.
                    Nickels is a very unique dog- he is allergic to meat. His favorite word is “present.” His
                    one true joy is receiving and opening gifts with his family.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2020, Nickels’ brought home a new dog: Socks. Socks is potentially the villain in Nickels’ life.
                    He destroys Nickels’ favorite toys and is highly allergic to peanut butter, which means Nickels now
                    rarely gets his favorite treat! However, when you find them sharing a dog bed, you wonder if the sibling
                    rivalry is all a facade.

                    OK Hugo is a very energetic and excitable dog just last week. He killed his first bunny

                    Hugo is a very generous dog. Hugo once gave me a birthday present where
                    he slapped me in the face with a broom. He was very nice about it tho and
                    after he punched me in the face with his paw and I almost bled to death.
